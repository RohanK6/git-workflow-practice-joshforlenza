## My Thoughts
<p>As everyone has seen in the news recently, ChatGPT has been a huge topic of debate in the software industry. It has caused panic amongst software engineers and soon-to-be graduates who fear that the AI technology could replace software engineering jobs. This article gives insight into the capabilities of the AI by discussing a Google document that reveals ChatGPT is able to pass the tests required for an entry-level job at the company. This article interests me because I will be looking for a job in the industry in a little over a year, and it makes me question how AI will affect the job market and the interview process for jobs. Like many others, I fear that it will make the search for a job difficult. Of course ChatGPT can't act like an actual human; however, the fact that it can pass interview tests for one of the biggest tech companies is frightening. I don't think the effects of the AI will be felt for some time, so I guess I won't really know how the industry until I start the job search in a year. Hopefully, ChatGPT ends up as a tool rather than a replacement for software developers.</p>

### A comment from Harry
I think the message from ChatGPT that it will never be a full replacement, but rather a tool to assist software engineers is accurate. I am
afraid that the demand from employers to use chatGPT will outpace it's usefulness to developers.
